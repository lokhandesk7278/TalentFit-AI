# TalentFit AI – Resume–Job Fit Analyzer

**TalentFit AI** is an AI-powered Resume–Job Fit Analyzer that simulates how modern Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) evaluate resumes.
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Hugging Face transformer models** to provide explainable match scores, skill gap analysis, and AI-driven resume improvement suggestions.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. User uploads a Resume and Job Description
2. Text is extracted and preprocessed
3. Similarity analysis is performed using:

   * TF-IDF (keyword-based)
   * Semantic embeddings (transformer-based)
4. Skills and keyword gaps are identified
5. AI model generates ATS-optimized resume suggestions
6. Results are displayed through a multi-tab dashboard
